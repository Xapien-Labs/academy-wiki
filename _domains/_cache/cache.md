What are the important problems for your field? What is the purely teleological case for pursuing the study in them?
Chemistry: Batteries, Solar Cell, BioChemistry
Bio: Curiosity, Diseases, Medicine/Care, Anti-Aging, Proteins, Synthetics
Physics: Rockets/Space, Optics/Photonics, Curiosity, Mathematics: Nearly None - As a Baseline. Low Practical Fields: Economics (Mostly easy), Law, Finance. CS, AI: Known. EE: Moore and other Trends. Mech: Flying Vehicles, Electric, RPA. Civil: Tools Available, Only good for Megaprojects. EE (Power), Chem Eng: Industrial Processes for Creating (Old Knowledge). BioTech: Same as Bio. Philosophy: Good for a past time. Others are not that impactful.
Architecture, Environmental Eng., Material Science

Online learning courses on platforms such as coursera and edX sucks, except one or two courses.
udemy is the best for now, except for the machine learning on coursera course. Mostly people are upset at the depth to which these courses go. Not great depth.

We want to all the way to down to becoming a world expert and opening a deeptech company and then working through that
