## Contracts — Torts — Procedure — Real Estate — Criminal — Evidence.

Contract law teaches the basic principles that underlie individual interactions. The ideas of competent parties, meetings of the mind, and consideration are taught and then have application across a wide variety of other sub-specialties, from banking to buying and selling a house.

Torts which means twisted in Latin, teaches the basic manner that civil disputes are handled by the court system, notions of duty, breach, causation, and damages are taught, and then have application, from products liability, to slander.

Procedure — Typically civil procedure but also criminal procedure adds structure to the court system and leads us to work through or with the court system with everyone working under the same rule set.

Real Estate is one part contract law, but also one part old English tax abatement law that has held over into the American system which defines a myriad of other matters such as remainder interests, present possessory interests, leases, licenses, mortgages, deeds of trust, and even touches on wills and estates. As an old real property professor once said, “if you conclude that no one or everyone owns the property, then you are wrong — go back and start over again, because if its true, the whole world flies apart and the entire system comes unraveled.”

Criminal Law — Comes at you from another angle. Its interesting to see what’s “legal” and what’s a crime, but while interesting, Criminal law is primarily taught for statute interpretation. Its only a crime if a statute prohibits the act. Learning how to read a statute and pick out the particular elements of a statute are of paramount concerns.

Evidence which isn’t usually taught the first year, brings in another layer, its about how to enter evidence into court, and just as important what isn’t evidence or how to hold out evidence that shouldn’t be produced. While the subject is very complex, its really trying to teach a lawyer how to conduct a court proceeding, while also teaching how not to conduct a court proceeding.

In civil law legal system (aka Roman law), main branches are Private law and Public law.

Private law deals with interactions between individuals. And it contains civil law, law of obligations, commercial law and international private law.
Public law, on the other hand, deals with interrelations between the state and the general population. And it contains constitutional law, penal law, administrative law, tax law and international law.
There is also a third branch, which is like a mix of public law and private law: employment law, enforcement and bankruptcy law.
